This repository has separate folders for each of the five Scopes constituting the Atlas Alignment Artifact. This structure is intended to make review of the current Atlas data more accessible. 

An additional goal is to enable people to compare the current Atlas with the version prepared in the latter part of 2023. At this time, work on Atlas gen2 was initiated on recurring community calls hosted by Rune Christensen. Stakeholders gathered to learn about the vision and design of the Atlas. Alignment Conservers prepared Supporting Documents and some of these were integrated into the Atlas draft prepared by Rune.

The latest version of Rune's Atlas draft has been uploaded here as `11.30 version`. It contains Supporting Document types that have since been deprecated. 

Atlas Axis will duplicate this file and overwrite the duplicate with one that aggregates all the current Scopes' data. By using Github's native diff checker, Atlas students can pinpoint how the Atlas has evolved.
