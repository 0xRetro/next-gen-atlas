FacilitatorDAOs are expected to take swift action appropriate to the category of ecosystem stakeholder, including derecognition of the AC or offboarding the Ecosystem Actor.\n This general expectation becomes a mandate if the proximity of Alignment Conservers to the instigating action renders it reasonable to expect that they should have detected the unfolding organizational drift. The assessment of reasonableness in this context does not hinge on the action/inaction (lack of attention or diligence) of an individual Alignment Conserver. Instead, the inquiry is based on a reasonable-person standard, and applied to the customary professional expectations associated with the Alignment Conserver position.

(See also the definition of \"Incentivized Alignment\" [here](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#incentivized-alignment).)\n If effective, Incentivized Alignment may lead to an ecosystem actor behaving in ways that are outwardly indistinguishable from the behavior of an actor who is inherently Universally Aligned.\n AVCs are tasked with modifying the Scope Alignment Artifacts so that Incentivized Alignment is brought increasingly in line with Universal Alignment.\n The degree of congruence, or fit, between Incentivized Alignment and Universal Alignment is termed \"Spiritual Alignment\" in the Target Document.",

Evidence of proactive mitigation that meets the “process” requirement of Neutrality can include AVC Members' proactively disclosing conflicts of interest (versus only disclosing after being confronted with the conflict of interest by a third party); recusal from voting; or refraining from contributing to discussions implicating a potential conflict of interest.\n As to the “results” element:  an AVC has justified its Scope Proposals against the objective of Neutrality when it explains how its proposed changes (the processes, procedures or mechanisms) preserve or enhance: 1) the impartiality of governance processes or their resilience to corruption or capture by self-serving special interests; 2) stakeholders' context-appropriate access to contribute to governance processes on a level playing field; and 3) transparent reporting of the implementation and outcomes of governance processes.",
